# Yahoo close price stock prediction for Apple

I have focused on building a model that is capable of predicting a close price for Apple company. However, this script can be modified and train a new model for any other company of users choice. There are 3 main classes in it:

1. Scraping latest data from yahoo by dates that user provides
2. Training model for a new company if user decided to choose other than Apple company
3. Do predictions
